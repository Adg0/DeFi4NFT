Welcome to Defi4!
=================

Guide
^^^^^
Defi4NFT dapp is an NFT collateralizing app on Algorand. Powered by circle digital money, which let's you use any NFT you hold in Algorand as leverage for borrowing stable coin in Defi4.
Leveraged NFT remains locked in your (*borrower*) address until the full loan amount is repaid, which is a **pure non-custodial** transaction.
Assets(NFT) that require KYC or special permissions might benefit from this *pure non-custodial protocol*.

With a 3% return for liquidity providers that supply liquidity to the protocol, Defi4 becomes the go-to site for delivering liquidity for NFTs.
Liquidity providers will keep their liquidity asset in their account until a borrower uses it, at which point the protocol will reward them with an I-O-U stable-coin token plus 3% of the lent amount.
