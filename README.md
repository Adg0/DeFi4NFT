DeFi4NFT is a borrow/lend platform for NFTs on Algorand. At the core a state machine stores the loan health of a pure non-custodial borrow/lend protocol.

Pure non-custodial means assets remain in the owner’s wallet, for borrowers this means collateral assets remain frozen in address. And for liquidity providers this means creating a delegated logicSig promising to provide a loan when a borrower matches, aka promise. And for liquidators this means a three way transaction, where the end receiver is a third party buyer willing to buy the borrower’s collateral NFT and the liquidator pays the debt of the borrower while a third party buyer sends payment of the collateral NFT to liquidator. This system is set up so permissioned tokens can be open to receive liquidity from non-whitelisted addresses.
